      <p>
        By reporting your rent payments, you can possibly benefit like our other users that have seen an increase in their credit score.
        These increases have helped our users qualify for a home loan sooner than without reporting their rent. In some cases, users have
        gone from not qualifying for a home loan, to getting pre-qualified in just one reporting cycle.
